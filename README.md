# SoarETX Black & White Radios

Credits:  This project was started by Jasper Frekmann as a port from SoarOTX to EdgeTX. My plan is to host the code and update it as needed.

This is a program package for radio controlled model sailplanes class F3K, F3J, F3RES, and F5J. It runs on FrSky Taranis QX7, X9D, X9D+, 
and Xlite radio transmitters with OpenTX firmware. The package contains model definitions in .otx files, 
and a number of Lua scripts for telemetry screens.

Please refer to the Wiki for instructions on how to install and use the programs.
